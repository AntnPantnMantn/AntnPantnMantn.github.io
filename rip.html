<h1>R.I.P. AntnPantnMantn.github.io</h1>
<font style="font-size:10px;">(it's been blocked at school)</font>
<h2><i><u>But there is still hope!</u></i></h2>
<br>
I am thinking of ways to get around the the system. perhaps hosting it on my own
server with a dynamic IP?<br>
<br>
And yes i could make a new sub-domain on github, but IT could easily just block 
it again. And if that keeps happening they might block github all together:(<br>
<br>
